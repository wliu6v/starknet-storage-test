Test the serialization results of several different structures in Starknet.

Environment:
```
Protostar version: 0.13.0                                                                                                              
Cairo-lang version: 0.11.1.1
Cairo 1 compiler version: 1.1.0
```

The main test is to generate an object and store it in storage, and then read it out to see if the result is correct. 

1. FeltObj

Cannot be read properly, error reported, suspected to be related to u8 attribute

```
Execution was reverted; failure reason: [0x53746f726167654163636573735538202d206e6f6e207538].
```

0x53746f726167654163636573735538202d206e6f6e207538 means `StorageAccessU8 - non u8`

2. FeltNou8Obj

After changing the u8 property in the object to u32, it can be read, but when there is a felt252 type in the object property, all the property values read are the values of the last field when the object was serialized

```
[ "3421494", "3421494", "3421494", "3421494" ]
```

3. NoFeltObj

After removing the felt252 attribute, it can be read normally with or without the u8 type attribute

```

```
